This is a reference tool and character sheet I put together for 5e. 

The reference folder (SRD_2014) is based on OldManUmby's D&D 5E SRD REmastered, but feel free to add homebrew or other info from a variety of sources if you own them! 

This is probably not the easiest template to use, I didn't originally plan on sharing it. The main sheet "[Quick Sheet](Quick%20Sheet.md)" should be viewed in source mode first to update all info for your character. First, update the metadata at the top of the page. From there, skip the first code block as that is all HP button functions. Then, update everything from "Player" to "Ship Stats" with your character info. 

For spell references at the bottom of the sheet, I sanitized it to only include what is available through the SRD Remastered, but feel free to use the "Spells Callouts" template in Assets>OtherReference>Template, and sort spells as individual markdown files using the following structure:

Assets
- SRD_2014
	- Character Options
		- Spells
			- cantrips
			- level-1
			- level-2
			- level-3
			- level-4
			- level-5
			- level-6
			- level-7
			- level-8
			- level-9

Sorry if it's clunky, I built what worked for me and decided to share it after the fact!
