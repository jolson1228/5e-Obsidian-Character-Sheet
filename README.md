This is a reference tool and character sheet I put together for 5e. 

The reference folder (SRD_2014) is based on OldManUmby's D&D 5E SRD REmastered, but feel free to add homebrew or other info from a variety of sources if you own them! 

This is probably not the easiest template to use, I didn't originally plan on sharing it. The main sheet "[Quick Sheet](Quick%20Sheet.md)" should be viewed in source mode first to update all info for your character. First, update the metadata at the top of the page. From there, skip the first code block as that is all HP button functions. Then, update everything from "Player" to "Ship Stats" with your character info. 

For spell references at the bottom of the sheet, I sanitized it to only include what is available through the SRD Remastered, but feel free to use the "Spells Callouts" template in Assets>OtherReference>Template, and sort spells as individual markdown files using the following structure:

Assets
- SRD_2014
	- Character Options
		- Spells
			- cantrips
			- level-1
			- level-2
			- level-3
			- level-4
			- level-5
			- level-6
			- level-7
			- level-8
			- level-9

Sorry if it's clunky, I built what worked for me and decided to share it after the fact! 

If you have PDFs of additional content, you can use Marker PDF to MD, or what I did was had ChatGPT (4o) convert it a few pages at a time. 

Couldn't upload to Github as one big folder, so I uploaded the zip. Download the zip, uncompress it to where you want your vault, and use the uncompressed folder as your vault (without renaming, your vault will be "DnD Template"). It should have all the plugins in the .obsidian file if you do it this way but just in case, here is the list. If it doesn't have a note, it's probably necessary but feel free to play around and disable some to see what breaks it! 

- Admonitions
- Advanced Tables
- *Custom Frames* - If you want to open DnDBeyond in Obsidian, otherwise not necessary
- Dataview
- *DBFolder* - I don't think I ended up using this one, feel free to try disabling. 
- Dice Roller
- Folder Notes
- *Homepage* - If you want to set the quick sheet as your homepage, otherwise not necessary. 
- JSEngine
- *Kanban* - Don't think its used anywhere
- *Linter* - You don't need it, but it is super helpful if you import source materials. 
- *Markdown Table Editor* - I used it a bunch to make the quick sheet, but I don't think you need it for gameplay
- ***Marker PDF to MD*** - Helpful for importing source material, but not necessary for gameplay. 
- Metabind
- *Modal Forms* - I can't remember if this one in necessary, feel free to experiment!
- Obsidian Columns
- Style Settings
- Templater
- *Various Complements* - Handy for linking spells/feats/weapons to your quick sheet but not necessary.
